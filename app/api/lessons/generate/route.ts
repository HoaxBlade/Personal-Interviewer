    ### Important Guidelines:
    - The lesson should feel like a **teacher is explaining the topic** naturally.
    - **Dynamically decide** how to introduce the topic:  
      - Start with a real-world scenario, a question, an interesting fact, or a common misconception.  
    - Ensure the lesson **varies its structure** depending on the topic.  
    - Do not say stuff like normal conversation, just create couse content as if it is in a book. Also no need to mention the title of the lesson at the top.
    - Do not forget to use markdown effectively to make sure that the content is very readable. Do not feel restricted to use #, ## or ###. Everything is allowed for markdown format.
    - You can also use tables to display content.
    - Put visual representations in pre code block if any.
    - Additional Instructions from user side: **${additionalInstructions || 'No additional instructions'}**.

    ### **Important Guidelines:**
    - Use markdown **normally** for headings (#, ##, ###, etc.), bullet points, and formatting.
    - **Do not wrap the entire response in a single preformatted code block (\`\`\`).**
    - Use code blocks **only** when writing actual code (\`\`\`language) or ASCII diagrams.
    - Structure the content as if it were **a book chapter** rather than a casual conversation.
    - Keep the content **unique, engaging, and structured naturally.**
    
    ### Content Structure (Flexible Based on the Topic, No need to go with the exact headings/paragraphs)
    1. **Introduction**  
       - Briefly introduce the topic in a way that grabs attention.  
       - Mention why it's important and how it's used in real life.  
       - Add more information that you feel is good and that is being taught in real world educational platforms.
    
    2. **Core Concepts** (Modify this structure based on complexity)  
       - Use headings, bullet points, and explanations in a natural way.  
       - Include **examples, diagrams, or real-world cases**.  
       - If applicable, provide **step-by-step walkthroughs** (e.g., for coding topics).  
       - If historical, show **timelines or evolution**.  
    
    3. **Interactive Elements (Encourage User Engagement)**  
       - Pose a **thought-provoking question** or challenge.  
       - Suggest a **small hands-on activity** (e.g., writing code, researching a real case). 
       
    4. **Add more topics that you feel necessaary**
    
    5. **Summary & Next Steps**  
       - Recap the key takeaways in **a concise, bullet-point format**.  
       - Suggest how to apply the knowledge.  
    
    ---
    âš¡ **Customization Based on Topic**:  
    - If it's a **technical lesson**, include **code snippets, formulas, or visual diagrams**.  
    - If it's about **history or business**, use **storytelling or case studies**.  
    - If it's an **abstract concept**, use **analogies and everyday examples**.  
    ---
    
    ðŸ’¡ **Ensure the lesson is unique and engaging each time!**  
    - **Avoid starting every lesson the same way** â€“ mix up introductions.  
    - Adjust **depth and details based on topic complexity**.  
    - Keep it **structured but dynamic** so it feels like a real instructor teaching naturally.
